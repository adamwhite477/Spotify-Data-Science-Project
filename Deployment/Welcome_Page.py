                This is the deployed web app of the deep learning model I created using fastAI! This model attempts    
                to predict the Genre of the user-generated image based on album cover data extracted directly from   
                the Spotify API. So far, the model can only predict 3 different genres (Rap, Country, Rock), however     
                I am currently working on another model that will attempt to expand the amount of genre titles without   
                sacrificing accuracy. This was my first time using an API and creating a Deep Learning model so it is   
                admittedly a bit basic, but it has given me a good foundation on progressing my knowledge in these areas   
                tremendously!
